% Performs the normalization of glottal waveform input invFilterResults.glotFlow based on applying
% both scaling and DC removal of each signal period so as to resemble the
% reference ground-truth (GT) glottal waveform speechData.glotFlowGT. 

% For each signal period, based on input timeMarks.pitchMarks (Glottal Closure Instants), the optimum scale and 
% DC coefficients are computed based on RMSE between the reference period
% and the modified signal.
% Normalized glottal wavform and its derivative are returned as glotFlowInvFiltOpt and
% glotFlowDInvFiltOpt, respectively, and the scaling and DC parameters for each signal
% period are returned in a_gif and b_gif, respectively.

% parameters are a parametric linear regression between input glottal waveform invFilterResults.glotFlow
% and the ground-truth glottal one, in order to perform a pairwise
% comparison 
% Input timeMarks.pitchMarks are used to perform the linear regressions
